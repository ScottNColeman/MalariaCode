function [du] = DirectionalDerivative(u)
%DIRECTIONALDERIVATIVE returns (du/dt + du/ds) required to update PDE
%
% INPUTS:  u  - residents in each of the I classes at the previous time and
%               resident time step i.e. u^(m-1)_(n-1) for all classes
% OUTPUTS: du - the vector of (du/dt + du/ds) for each class (1 x 1 x I)

du = zeros(size(u));
